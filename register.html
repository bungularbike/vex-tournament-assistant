		<p><strong>Welcome to VEX Tournament Assistant!</strong></p>
		<p>VEX Tournament Assistant is a scouting helper for VEX Robotics Competition (VRC) tournaments. It can let you take notes on teams at your events, predict the outcome of matches, and compile data across multiple competitions a team has attended.</p>
		<p>VEX Tournament Assistant is developed by Team 936A from Hong Kong International School. We will <u>never</u> access your data (including your e-mail address and team notes) and/or transfer it to other parties.</p>
		<p><small>VRC, VEX, and VEX Robotics are trademarks of Innovation First International, Inc. All data compiled by VEX Tournament Assistant is from the publicly accessible <a href = "https://vexdb.io/the_data" target = "_blank">VexDB API</a>.</small></p>
